# Touchpad Gesture Customization
This extension modifies and extends existing touchpad gestures on GNOME using Wayland. This project is a fork of [gnome-gesture-improvements](https://github.com/harshadgavali/gnome-gesture-improvements). Since the original project seems to be no longer maintained, I setup this project with the aim of taking over the development and maintenance of this wonderful extension that I relied on for daily use.

**Note**: I have removed the support for X11 since I only use Wayland, but this can be added again in the future if needed and if someone is willing to support this.

#### For activating snapping/tiling gesture (inverted T gesture)
1. Do a 3/4-fingers vertical swipe downward gesture on a unmaximized window but don't release the gesture
2. Wait a few milliseconds
3. Do a 3/4-fingers horizontal swipe gesture to tile a window to either side of the screen

#### For activating application gesture
1. Activating a 3/4-fingers hold gesture on touchpad by pressing your fingers on touchpad but don't release the gesture
2. Wait a few milliseconds
3. Do a 3/4-fingers horizontal swipe gesture to activate application gesture (an arrow animation cicle will appear)

#### Application Gesture Notes
* For horizontal gestures, application gesture only works if 3/4-fingers horizontal swipe is set to **Window Swithing**
* Application gesture also supports vertical swipe but is still experimental and requires users to turn off other actions for 3/4-figners vertical swipe (i.e. set the action to None).

#### Notes
* Enbaling minimising window gesture for Window Manipulation will disable snapping/tiling gesture.
* If you are using an older version of GNOME, there might be a bug which prevent the extension from detecting **hold and swipe gesture** and **pich gesture**. If you face this problem, the gesture can only work if the mouse pointer is pointed at the desktop or top panel.

## Customization
* To switch to windows from *all* workspaces using 3-fingers swipes, run 
```
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.window-switcher current-workspace-only false
```
